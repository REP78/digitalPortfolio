                <div class="fw-text"><!-- ParagraphBodyStart --><p>The system is being developed for tracking objects, such as robots and other vehicles, on the Lunar or Martian surface where there are no satellites available to be utilized. The system relies on multiple antennas receiving an Ultra wideband signal (3.2 - 7.1 GHz) from a transmitter (tracking object).&#160; When the signals are received the position can be determined by the time delays relative to a reference antenna. </p><p><b>Matlab simulations</b></p><p>For further discovery of the capabilities of three dimensional tracking, I was given the task of building on existing Matlab code.&#160; I verified the ideal distance for the receive antennas, how accurate the tracking would be with the next generation of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radios.&#160; I also submitted my own antenna configuration that would allow for the losses associated with the propagation of bipolar antennas. </p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://robert-pound.webs.com/Pioneer_Outdoor_Robot_GPS.jpg" style="margin: 8px" class="fw_image_computer fwSizeProp" /></p><p><b>Research Robot</b></p><p>I was the first person in the branch to operate the research Robot P3AT (Mobile Robots Inc.).&#160; The P3AT was purchased by Avionics Branch at Johnson Space Center (EV4) to evaluate the UWB tracking system specifically for Honeywell whom use the robot in lunar surface experiments.&#160; I was tasked with test and verification to ensure that we received a working robot.&#160; I then had to learn all the various demo software related to the robot to determine the best way to control it for future demonstrations. To establish a wireless connection I had several options and had to fabricate a couple of different cables to test out the connections. Finally I wrote an operating procedure for the robot that allowed EV4 to demo their concepts for tracking at Kennedy Space Center in December of 2007. </p><p><b>Bi-conical Antennas</b></p><p>The antennas used in the UWB tracking experiments that were provided by Time Domain Corporation are limited in that the field that they emit is not uniform.&#160; There was an existing bi-conical antenna that had been fabricated by a previous co-op student that they had adopted for the tracking project.&#160; I set out to make 6 more similar to this antenna but cut specifically for the project.&#160; After several attempts I created a single working antenna that I tested and validated using the vendors antennas as a reference.&#160; I then proceeded with the fabrication of the next 5 antennas. Testing confirmed that all 6 antennas produced a uniform field with no more than 1 dB of variance in any direction. </p><!-- ParagraphBodyEnd --></div>
