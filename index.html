        <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Engineering Synopsis</h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>At <b>Quest Software</b> I had the opportunity to work with several tools in the database management space and created a wide range of video content supporting the community of developers and DBAs that use the tools.</p>
          <p>As a Product Technologist at <b>Dell Software</b>, I developed a series of collateral around the Dell business intelligence platform which included Toad Data Point, Toad Decision Point and Toad Intelligence Central.</p>
          <p>As a Systems Engineer in <b>Dell</b>'s Enterprise Solutions Group I developed scripts, documentation and user interface for a data warehouse appliance. I have also took on the role of project manager, interacting and training the various stakeholders involved with the appliance and presenting materials to end users at different venues, such as the Dell Enterprise Forum.</p>
          <p>Working on the Power series servers in Failure Analysis at <b>IBM</b> I verified fault conditions for field and manufacturing failures. I also preformed processor characterization, creating and running custom scripts and automation to collect data on processor to validate performance of processor. Undertook an initiative to create a user interface for a Java automation application, allowing other engineers to more effectively use the test automation tools.</p>
          <p>During my time at the <b>University of Texas</b> I participated in a research program, Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering, where I assisted a graduate mentor fabricating and investigating the benefits of capacitors created using non-silicon materials. As the president of the University of Texas Amateur Radio Club I organized and ran club meetings, organized club events and was the driving force in the transition of the club into a new facility. I took a leadership role on my senior design team which designed, built and tested a color tracking robot. The team successfully worked together and the project won second place out of thirty teams in the design competition.&#160;</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Personal</h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
                <p>I am a driven worker that has a proven track record for getting the job done. I not only excel in my area of expertise but also understands how my contributions impact the organization. Because of my hands on experience I have the ability to put things in simple terms and can communicate my ideas to people with all levels of technical ability.</p>
                <p>I was born in San Diego California but raised in Sequim Washington. Growing up in a small town in close proximity to the Olympic National Forrest, I became an outdoor enthusiast very early on. After High school I joined the United States Air Force as a radio technician and traveled all over the world. Near the end of his enlistment I made the decision to pursue an education and after several years I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. </p>
                <p>Outside my professional life I enjoy travel and had the opportunity to live in: Texas, Mississippi, Republic of South Korea, Germany During my time in the Air Force. I have also traveled to the Philippines Islands, Italy, Belgium, Holland, the Czech republic, Switzerland, England, Luxembourg, France, Canada, Mexico and Belize. I have visited a few National parks but hope to someday visit all of the major National parks in the United States.</p>
                <p>My newest passion is motorcycle riding and I made a ~1600 mile trip from Washington state to Reno NV and back in my first year riding.&#160;</p>
                <p> I also enjoy playing the guitar, hiking and backpacking, reading science fiction, reading adventure/outdoor/survival stories, watching football, and developing video games.&#160; </p>
