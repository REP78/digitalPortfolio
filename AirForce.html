              <p style="text-align: left" align="center">Working at Detachment 5 of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) I was exposed to an array of transmitters and scientific equipment that was unique to any other Air Force assignment. While there I operated and maintained transmitters from 2.54 GHz to 95 GHz as well as developed maintenance procedures for many of the primary transmitters. Not only did I fabricate coaxial and multi-pin cables but I was also involved in building RF transparent test stands that were used in the Anechoic chambers for experiments.</p>
              <p>In addition to the technical aspects of my time at AFRL I also had several secondary roles which included Security Forces augmentee following the Sept 11 attacks, equipment manager, branch purchasing agent, precision test equipment calibration manager and technical orders custodian. </p>
              <p>I was also involved in training personnel on the operation of equipment. In particular we held a training session once a quarter to teach bio-environmental trainees from the technical school how to operate field radiation meters in one of the sites many Anechoic chambers. Finally I had the opportunity to take a leadership role during an AFRL wide inspection. I planned for and then lead a team of more than fifty people on a single day to identify and document all equipment not on inventory. Later I assisted other branches in the planning and execution of there own plan to make their sections ready for inspection. The end result was an excellent inspection rating and a Best practice award. </p>

            <div class="w3-content"><!-- ParagraphBodyStart --><p style="text-align: left" align="center">Soon after I was assigned to the 606th Air Control Squadron (ACS), the unit was tasked with a deployment to Italy in support of Operation Allied Force. I was immediately put to work going through packing lists, checking equipment, organizing and reorganizing equipment in a week long effort of 15 hour days. At the end of this preparation I watched the majority of my shop, of whom I had just meet, speed off to Italy in what would become the longest convoy in Air Force History. Later during the last few months of my assignment I would be deployed to Ali Al Salem, Kuwait with a larger portion of my shop as the 606th was again tasked for forward deployed air control. At Ali Al Salem I was temporarily assigned to the Security Forces Squadron during a time of increased threat-con due to the terror attack on the U.S.S. Cole.</p><p>At the 606th my knowledge of radio equipment expanded as the inventory at this unit was much more diverse. I had the opportunity to maintain and trouble shoot several different kinds of Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF) and High Frequency (HF) radios. I was also tasked with managing the test equipment account, as well as managing technical orders. Finally I was involved in training personnel on the operation of a satellite radio that was recently added to the shop's inventory. </p><!-- ParagraphBodyEnd --></div>

I also was tasked with fabricating cables and and testing phone lines to ensure that remote systems were functioning. </p><!-- ParagraphBodyEnd --></div>
